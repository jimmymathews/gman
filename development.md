# Development

This program is in early development.

If you'd like, consider sharing recommendations or writing new features:

 1. Fix link order in saving
 2. Make new nodes' categories selectable on-the-fly
- Search function
- All-nodes view
- Filename tab completion
- Fix field editor page overflow
- Get relation / graph-edge names
- "Pruning" operations
- Merge graphs from file
- Mac/Windows support 
- Export to BibTex
- Export to plain text
- Unicode Greek letters and superscripts/subscripts (needs the wide chars from `ncursesw`)
- Figure out ncurses colors to get more than 8 choices
- Create complete sub-graphs ("cliques") on (small) selections

I would feel comfortable creating a release version 0 if I implemented 1 and 2.
