\section{Introduction} Let us consider the following system of 4
ordinary differential equations for 6 unknown functions $p_1,
p_2,p_3,$ $q^1,q^2,q^3$ of the variable $t$ 
$$ p_i
{dq^i\over dt}=0, \quad {dp_i\over dt}=\epsilon_{ijk}q^j{dq^k\over
dt},\quad i=1,2,3$$
 (we are using the summation
convention for repeated indices and the  symbol $\epsilon_{ijk}$, equal to $1$ for an even
permutation $ijk$ of $123$, -1 for an odd permutation, and 0
otherwise.)



It is convenient to recast these equations in  vector form by
introducing the notation
 $$\q=\left(\begin{matrix}q^1\\ q^2\\ q^3\end{matrix}\right)\in\R^3,\quad
\p=(p_1, p_2, p_3)\in\Rts.$$
Then, using the standard scalar and cross product
of vector calculus (and omitting the dot product symbol), the above
system can be written more compactly as
\begin{equation}\label{eqns} 
\p\q'=0, \quad \p'=\q\times \q'.
\end{equation}




This simple-looking  system of 4 ordinary differential equations for 6 unknown functions  enjoys a number of remarkable  properties and
interpretations, linking together old and new subjects, some of which we are going to explore in this article. The main themes  are 
\begin{itemize}
\item  generic  rank 2 distributions on 5-manifolds and their symmetries;
%\item  the geometry of split-octonions,
\item  4-dimensional pseudo-riemannian conformal geometry of split-signature;

\item  projective differential  geometry of plane curves. \end{itemize}
The relation between the first theme   and last  two is the main thrust  of this article. 


\subsection{Summary of main results}


\subsubsection{A $(2,3,5)$-distribution  and its symmetries}\label{nonint}
Geometrically,  Eqns.~ \eqns\ define at each point  $(\q,\p)\in\R^6$ (away from some ``small" subset)  a $2$-dimensional subspace $\D_{(\q,\p)}\subset T_{(\q,\p)}\R^6$. Put together, these subspaces define (generically) a rank 2 distribution  $\D\subset T\R^6$, a field of tangent 2-planes,  so that the solutions to our system of equations are precisely the {\em integral curves} of $\D$: the  parametrized curves $(\q(t), \p(t))$ whose velocity vector $(\q'(t), \p'(t))$   lies in  $\D_{(\q(t),\p(t))}$ at each moment $t$.
 
 Furthermore,  we see readily from  Eqns.~\eqref{eqns} that the function $\p\q=p^iq_i:\R^6\to\R$
  is a ``conserved quantity" (constant along solutions), so $\D$
   is  tangent everywhere to the level surfaces of $\p\q$. 
   By a simple rescaling argument (Sect.\,\ref{TwoTwo}),  
   it suffices to consider one of its non-zero  level surfaces,  
   say  $\Q:=\{\p\q=1\}$.  Restricted to $\Q$, the equation 
   $\p\q'=0$ is a consequence of $\p'=\q\times\q',$ 
   hence our system of Eqns.~\eqns\ reduces to  
\begin{equation}\label{eqnsss}
\p\q=1, \quad \p'=\q\times\q'.
\end{equation}


The system $(\Q,\D)$ given by Eqns.~\eqref{eqnsss} does not have any more conserved quantities, since  $\D$ {\em bracket-generates} $TQ$,  in two steps: $\D^{(2)}=[\D,\D]$ is a rank 3 distribution and $\D^{(3)}=[\D, \D^{(2)}]=T\Q.$ Such a distribution is called  $(2,3,5)$-distribution. 

The study of  $(2,3,5)$-distributions  has a rich and fascinating history. Their local geometry was studied by \'Elie Cartan in his   celebrated ``5-variable paper" of 1910 \cite{C_5var}, where  he showed that the symmetry algebra of such a distribution (vector fields  whose flow preserves $\D$) is at most 14-dimensional. The most symmetric case  is realized, locally  uniquely, on a certain compact homogeneous 5-manifold $\tQ$ for the 14-dimensional simple exceptional non-compact Lie group $\G$ (Sect.\,\ref{Three}) equipped with a $\G$-invariant $(2,3,5)$-distribution $\tD$. This maximally-symmetric $(2,3,5)$-distribution $\tD$  is called the Cartan-Engel distribution, and was in fact  used  by \'E.~Cartan and F.~Engel  in 1893 \cite{C1, Eng} to  {\em define} $\g_2$ as the automorphism algebra of this distribution (the modern definition of  $\G$ as the automorphism group of  the octonions did not appear until 1908 \cite{Ca3}). 

Using \'E. Cartan's theory of $(2,3,5)$ distributions -- in particular, his {\em submaximality} result  -- we show (Thm.~\ref{sym}) that our distribution $(\Q,\D)$, as given by Eqns.~\eqnsss, is maximally-symmetric, i.e. admits a 14-dimensional symmetry algebra isomorphic to $\g_2$, and hence is {\em locally} diffeomorphic to the  Cartan-Engel distribution $(\tQ, \tD)$. Eqns.~\eqnsss\ thus provide an explicit model, apparently new,  for the Cartan-Engel distribution.

\begin{theorem} The system $(\Q,\D)$ given by  equations \eqnsss\ is  a $(2,3,5)$-distribution  with a 14-dimensional symmetry algebra, isomorphic to $\g_2$, the maximum possible for a $(2,3,5)$-distribution,  and is thus locally diffeomorphic to the Cartan-Engel $\G$-homogeneous distribution $(\tQ, \tD)$.
\end{theorem}

 Most of the symmetries of Eqns.~\eqref{eqns} implied by  this theorem are not obvious at all (``hidden"). There is however an 8-dimensional subalgebra  $\slth\subset \g_2$  of  ``obvious" symmetries, generated by 
$$(\q,\p)\mapsto (g\q, \p g^{-1}), \quad g \in \SLth$$
 (the cross-product  in  Eqns.~\eqnsss\ can be defined via  the standard volume form on $\R^3$,
hence the occurrence of $\SLth$; see Sect.~\ref{TwoFour}). The group $\SLth$ then acts transitively and effectively on $\Q$, preserving $\D$, and will be our main tool for studying the system \eqns. 

To explain the  appearance of  $\g_2$ as the symmetry algebra of $(\Q,\D)$ 
we construct in Sect.~\ref{Three} an embedding of $(\Q,\D)$  in the  ``standard model'' $(\tQ, \tD)$ of  the Cartan-Engel distribution, defined in terms of the split-octonions $\tO$. Using Zorn's ``vector matrices" to represent split-octonions (usually it is done with pairs of ``split-quaternions") we get explicit formulas for the symmetry algebra of Eqns.~\eqns.    

\begin{theorem} There is an embedding $\SLth\hookrightarrow \G=\Aut(\tO)$ and an $\SLth$-equivariant 
   embedding  $\R^6\hookrightarrow \RP^6=\P(\Im(\tO))$ (an affine chart), identifying  $\Q$  with  
   the open dense orbit  of $\SLth$ in $\tQ$ and mapping $\D$ over to $\tD$. 
   The $\G$-action on $\tQ$ defines a Lie subalgebra of vector fields on $\Q$ isomorphic to $\g_2$ (a 14-dimensional simple Lie algebra), forming the symmetry algebra of $(\Q, \D)$. 
\end{theorem}

 
\begin{cor}\label{cor1}For  each  $A=(a^i_j)\in\slth$, $\b=(b^i)\in \R^3$ and $\bfc=(c_i) \in \Rts$  the vector field   on $\R^6$ 
\begin{eqnarray*}
X_{A,\b, \bfc}&=&[ 2b^i + a^i_jq^j + \epsilon_{ijk}p^j c^k -(p_jb^j+ c_j q^j)q^i]\partial_{q^i} 
\\ &&
\qquad+[2c_i-a_i^jp_j  + \epsilon^{ijk}q_j b_k- (p_j b^j +c_j q^j )p_i]\partial_{p_i }
\end{eqnarray*}
is tangent to $\Q$ and preserves $\D$. The collection of these vector fields defines a 14-dimensional subalgebra of the Lie algebra of vector fields on $\Q$, isomorphic to $\g_2$, and forming the symmetry algebra of the system $(\Q, \D)$ defined by Eqns.~\eqns.
\end{cor}

\subsubsection{4-dimensional conformal  geometry in split signature}
Let $\M\subset\RPt\times\RPts$ be the (open dense) subset of {\em non-incident point-line pairs} $(q,p).$ There is a principal fibration 
 $\R^*\to\Q\to\M$ (the ``pseudo-Hopf-fibration") defined by regarding $(\q,\p)\in\Q$ as  homogeneous coordinates  of the pair $(q,p)=([\q], [\p])\in \M$. The fibration $\Q\to\M$ defines naturally a  pseudo-riemannian metric on  $\M$  by  a  standard procedure: restrict the flat $(3,3)$-signature metric on $\R^6$ given by $\p\q$  to $\Q$, then project to $\M$, using the fact that the principal $\R^*$-action on $\Q$ is by isometries. We call the resulting metric $\met$ on $\M$  the {\em dancing metric}. A similar procedure defines an orientation on $\M$. The dancing metric is a self-dual pseudo-riemannian metric of signature $(2,2)$, non-flat, irreducible,  $\SLth$-symmetric (as well as many other remarkable properties, see Thm.~\ref{Ten}). 

\begin{rmrk} Although only the conformal class $[\met]$ of the dancing metric is eventually used in this article, it is natural to consider the dancing metric $\met$ itself, as it is the unique (up to a constant)  $\SLth$-invariant metric in its class.
\end{rmrk}

 The main result in Sect.~\ref{pr} is  a correspondence between the geometries   of  $(\Q,\D)$ and $(\M,[\met])$. 

\begin{theorem}
The  above defined ``pseudo-Hopf-fibration"  $\Q\to \M$  establishes a bijection between  integral curves in   $(\Q,\D)$   and non-degenerate  null curves in $(\M,[\met])$ with   {\em parallel self-dual tangent null 2-plane}.\end{theorem}


The   condition ``parallel  self-dual tangent null 2-plane" on a null curve in an oriented  split-signature conformal 4-manifold can be regarded as ``one-half" of  the  geodesic equations. Every null-direction  is the unique intersection of two null 2-planes, one self-dual and the other anti-self-dual. It follows that given a null-curve in such a manifold  there are  two fields of tangent null 2-planes defined along it, one self-dual and the other anti-self-dual, intersecting in the tangent line. A null  curve is a geodesic if and only if its tangent line is parallel, which  is equivalent to the two  tangent fields of null 2-planes being  parallel; for our curves, only the self-dual field   is required to be parallel, hence ``half-geodesics".  

We derive various explicit formulas for the dancing metric. Perhaps the most elementary expression is the following: use the local coordinates $(x,y,a,b)$ on $\M$ where  $(x,y)$ are the Cartesian coordinates of a point $q\in\RPt$ (in some affine chart) and  $(a,b)$ the coordinates of a line $p\in\RPts$ given by $y=ax+b$. Then 
$$\met\sim  da[(y - b)dx - xdy] + db[adx - dy],$$
where $\sim$ denotes conformal equivalence. See 
Sect.~\ref{simple} for a quick derivation of this formula using the {\em dancing condition} (appearing also in the abstract to this paper, after which we name  the metric $\met$). An  explicit formula for the dancing {\em metric} $\met$ in  homogeneous coordinates  is given  in  Sect.~\ref{first} (Prop.~\ref{homo}). In Sect.~\ref{ss_cr} we give another formula for $\met$ in terms of  the cross-ratio. 



Following the twistor construction in  \cite{AN}, we show that  $(\Q, \D)$ can  be naturally identified with the {\em non-integrable locus} of  the  total space of the {\em self-dual twistor fibration} $\RP^1\to \T^+(\M)\to \M$ associated with $(\M,[\met])$, equipped with its twistor distribution $\D^+$. The non-integrability of $\D$ is then seen to be equivalent to the non-vanishing of the self-dual Weyl tensor of $\met$.

This explains also why we do not look at the ``other-half" of the null-geodesic equations on $\M$. They correspond to integral curves of the twistor distribution $\D^-$ on the anti-self-dual twistor space $\T^-(\M)$, which turns out to be integrable, due to the vanishing of the anti-self-dual Weyl tensor of $(\M,[\met])$. The resulting ``anti-self-dual-half-geodesics" can be easily described and are rather uninteresting from the point of view of this article (see Thm.~\ref{Ten}, Sect.~\ref{proper}). 



 \subsubsection{Projective geometry: dancing pairs and projective rolling.}\label{ProjGeom}
 
 
 Every integral curve of $(\Q,\D)$ projects, via $\Q\to\M\subset \RPt\times\RPts$, to a pair of curves $q(t), p(t)$ in $\RPt, \RPts$  (resp.). We offer two  interrelated projective geometric interpretations of the class of pairs of curves thus obtained:  ``dancing pairs" and ``projective rolling".   

By ``dancing" we refer to the interpretation of  $q(t), p(t)$   as the coordinated  motion of a non-incident point-line pair  in $\RPt$. We ask: what ``rules of choreography" should the  pair  follow so as to define (1) a null-curve in  $\M$ (2)  with a parallel self-dual tangent plane?  We call a pair of curves $q(t), p(t)$ satisfying these conditions a {\em dancing pair}. 

 The nullity condition on the pair  turns out to have a rather simple ``dancing" description. Consider a moving point  tracing a curve $q(t)$ in $\RPt$  with an associated  tangent line along it $q^*(t)\in\RPts$, the {\em dual curve} of  $q(t)$.  Likewise, a  moving line   in $ \RPt$ traces a curve $p(t)$ in $\RPts$,  whose dual curve $p^*(t)$ is a curve in $\RPt$, the   {\em envelope} of the family of lines in $\RPt$ represented by  $p(t)$, or  the curve in $\RPt$ traced out by the ``turning points" of the moving line $p(t)$. 


\begin{theorem}\label{intro_dancing}A   non-degenerate parametrized curve  in $(\M,[\met])$ is null if and only if the corresponding pair of curves  $(q(t), p(t))$  satisfies the ``dancing condition": {\em at each moment $t$, the point $q(t)$ is moving towards the turning  point $p^*(t)$ of  the line $p(t)$}. 
\end{theorem}
%
\begin{figure}[h]\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{dancing_pair_intro}
 \caption{The  dancing condition}\label{fig:dance}
\end{figure}
In Sect.~\ref{sec:mate} we pose the following ``dancing mate" problem: fix  an arbitrary  curve $q(t)$ in $\RPt$ (with some mild non-degeneracy condition) and find its ``dancing mates" $p(t)$; that is, curves $p(t)$ in $\RPts$ such that   $(q(t),p(t))$ 
is a null curve in $(\M, [\met])$ with parallel self-dual tangent plane.  Abstractly, it is clear that there is a 3-parameter family of dancing mates for a given $q(t)$, corresponding to ``horizontal lifts" of $q(t)$ to integral curves of $(\Q, \D)$ via $\Q\to \M\to \RPt$, followed by the projection $\Q\to \M\to \RPts$. 

We study the resulting correspondence of curves $q(t)\mapsto p(t)$ from the point of view of classical projective differential geometry. We find that this correspondence preserves the natural {\em projective structures} on the curves $q(t),p(t)$,  but in general does not preserve the {\em projective arc length} nor the {\em projective curvature} (these are the basic projective invariants of a plane curve; any two of the  three invariants form a complete set of projective  invariants for  plane curves). We use the existence of a common projective parameter $t$ on $q(t),p(t)$ and the dancing condition to derive the  ``dancing mate equation":
\begin{equation}\label{mate}
y^{(4)}+2{y'''y'\over y}+3ry'+r'y=0.\end{equation}
Here,  $q(t)$ is given in homogeneous coordinates by a ``lift" $A(t)\in\R^3\setminus 0$ satisfying $A'''+rA=0$ for some function $r(t)$  (this is called the Laguerre-Forsyth form of the tautological equation for a plane curve) and the dual curve to $p(t)$ is given in homogeneous coordinates by $B=-y'A+yA'$. 

We study the special case  of  {\em the dancing mates of the circle}. That is, we look for dancing pairs $(q(t), p(t))$ where $q(t)$ parametrizes a fixed  circle $\CC\subset \RPt$ (or conic, projectively they are all equivalent). We show how the  above dancing mate equation  (\ref{mate}) reduces in this case to the 3rd order ODE $y'''y^2=1$. The dual dancing mates  $p^*(t)$ form a 3-parameter family of curves in the exterior of the circle $\CC$. We show here a computer generated image of a 1-parameter family of solutions (all other curves can be obtained from this family by the subgroup  $\SLt\subset\SLth$ preserving $\CC$).
%
\begin{figure}[h]\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{dancing_mate_circle}
\caption{Dancing mates around  the circle: the point-dancer moves along  the central circle, starting at its ``north pole", moving clockwise. 
The line-dancer starts in the vertical position (``$y$-axis''), keeping always tangent to one of the curves that spiral around the circle (the envelope of the line's motion). At all moments they  comply with the dancing condition; the figure shows the tangent direction of the point-dancer at the moment it passes through the north pole (horizontal line segment)  and its incidence  with the ``turning point" of the line-dancer at that moment.}\label{circ}
\end{figure}
%

\sn 

 As another illustration we give in Sect.~\ref{const}  examples of dancing pairs with {\em constant projective curvature} (logarithmic spirals, ``generalized parabolas", and exponential curves).  

Finally, in  Sect.~\ref{RT} we turn to   the  ``projective rolling" interpretation of Eqns.~\eqref{eqns}: imagine the curves $q(t)$ and $p(t)$ as the contact points of the two projective planes $ \RPt ,  \RPts$ as they ``roll" along each other. When rolling two surfaces along each other, one needs to pick at each moment, in addition to a pair of contact points $(q,p)$ on the two surfaces, an identification of   the tangent spaces $T_q\RPt$, $T_p\RPts$ at these points. 
In the case of usual rolling of riemannian surfaces, the identification is required to be an {\em isometry}. 
Here, we introduce the notion of ``projective contact" between the corresponding tangent spaces: 
it is an identification $\psi:T_q\RPt\to T_p\RPts$ (linear isomorphism) which  sends each line through 
$q$ to its intersection point with the line $p$ (thought of as a line in the tangent space to $\RPts$ at $p$).
 
 
 Now a simple calculation shows that this ``projective contact" condition is equivalent   to the condition that the 
 {\em graph of $\psi$  is a self-dual null 2-plane} in $T_q\RPt\oplus T_q\RPts\simeq T_{(q,p)}M.$ 
 The configuration space for projective rolling is thus the space $\PC$ of such projective contact 
 elements  $(q,p,\psi)$. Continuing the 
 analogy with the rolling of riemannian surfaces, we define {\em projective rolling without slipping} 
 as a curve    $(q(t), p(t), \psi(t))$ in $\PC$ satisfying $\psi(t)q'(t)=p'(t)$ for all $t$. 
\begin{theorem}
A curve $(q(t),p(t),\psi(t))$ in $\PC$ satisfies the no-slip condition $\psi(t)q'(t)=p'(t)$ if and only if $(q(t),p(t))$ is  a null curve in $(\M,[\met])$ (equivalently, it satisfies the dancing condition of Thm.~\ref{intro_dancing}). 
\end{theorem} 

Our next task is to  translate the ``half-geodesic" condition (parallel self-dual tangent plane) to rolling language. We use a notion of parallel transport of lines along (non-degenerate) curves in the projective plane, formulated in terms of Cartan's {\em development of the osculating conic along the curve}  (the unique  conic that touches a given point on the curve to 4th order; see Sect. \ref{osc}). We then define the ``no-twist" condition on a curve of projective contact elements  $(q(t),p(t),\psi(t))$ as follows: if  $\ell(t)$ is a parallel family of lines along $q(t)$ then $\psi(t)\ell(t)$ is a parallel family along $p(t)$. 

\begin{theorem}
A projective rolling curve $(q(t),p(t),\psi(t))$ satisfies the no-slip and no-twist condition if and only if  $(q(t),p(t))$ is a null-curve in $\M$ with parallel self-dual tangent plane. Equivalently, $(q(t),p(t))$ is the projection via $\Q\to \M$ of an integral curve of $(\Q,\D)$. 
\end{theorem}

The no-twist condition can be thought of as a  ``2nd dancing condition" for the dancing pair $(q(t),p(t))$; admittedly, it is a rather demanding  one: the dancers should be aware of the 5th order derivative of their motion in order to comply with  it\dots We believe there should be a simpler dancing rule that captures the no-twist condition but could not find it. 


%This is an $\SLt$-invariant family of curves so, presumably, has  a characterization in terms of the geometry of the AdS plane.

  \subsection{Background}
 Our original motivation for this article stems from  the article of the third author  with Daniel An
 \cite{AN}, where the twistor construction for split-signature 4-dimensional conformal metrics was introduced, raising  the following natural question: for which split-signature conformal 4-manifolds  $\M$ the associated twistor distribution $\D^+$ on $\T^+\M$ is a {\em flat}  $(2,3,5)$-distribution? (That is, with  $\g_2$-symmetry, the maximum possible). 

This is a hard problem, even when $\M$ is a product of riemannian surfaces $(\Sigma_i, g_i)$, $i=1,2,$  equipped with the difference metric   $g=g_1\ominus g_2.$
 In this case, the integral curves of the twistor distribution  can be interpreted as modeling rolling without slipping or twisting of the two surfaces along each other. It was known for a while to  R. Bryant (communicated in various places, like \cite{BM,Zel}) that the only case of pairs of {\em constant curvature}   surfaces that gives rises  to a flat $(2,3,5)$-distribution is that of curvature ratio 9:1 (or spheres of radius ratio 3:1, in the positive curvature case), but An-Nurowski found  in \cite{AN} a   new family of  examples, and it is still unknown if more examples exist. 

These new examples   of An-Nurowski motivated us looking for {\em irreducible} split signature 4-dimensional conformal metrics with flat twistor distribution. A natural place to start are homogeneous manifolds $\M=G/H$, with $G\subset \G$. We know of a few such examples, but we found the case of  $\SL_3(\R)/\GL_2(\R)$ studied in this article  the most attractive, due to its  projective geometric flavor (``dancing"  and ``projective rolling" interpretations), so we decided to dedicate an article to this example alone.
